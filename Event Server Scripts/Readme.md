This script is for event servers only, this should NOT be run on a highly populated server for a length of time as this will bloat your database.  Upon each death a player will start off with 2 sets of armor, one red heavy set and one blue heavy set along with a few weapons.  Currently the game will not allow sql injection into hotbars and player inventories on relog / before death respawn, but we can still use this for injecting armor type items into their equipped slots for events if you choose.  Not a bad Idea for an event server still.
